## DECISION LOG

Key decisions made during design or implementation that affect the plan. Append new entries chronologically.

| Date | Decision | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-27 | How to manage holidays/week-offs | A) Pre-populate day_records for all employees on holiday add; B) Lazy config tables, consult at apply/approve time | **B — Lazy config tables** | Pre-populate is O(employees × days) — expensive, brittle. Config tables are lightweight and always authoritative. |
| 2026-04-27 | Who manages the holiday calendar | A) SA manages globally; B) HR manages per-company with SA-assigned permission | **B — HR manages per-company** | SA should not be the daily operator of HR data. Same governance pattern as leave types. |
| 2026-04-27 | Default week-off days | — | **Saturday + Sunday** | Standard 5-day working week. Stored as ISO weekday [6, 7]. Per-company override supported via `company_week_off_config`. |
| 2026-04-27 | Sandwich Leave Policy | A) Enforce at apply-time (show user, block/charge); B) Enforce at approve time; C) Don't enforce, leave it to HR | **A — Enforce at apply-time** | User sees the impact before submitting. Transparent. No surprises at approve time. HR doesn't need to manually adjudicate. |
| 2026-04-27 | Block rule for zero working days | Always block | **Always block** | An application with zero working days is meaningless — employee is applying for a holiday/weekend. Blocked at API level with clear error. |
| 2026-04-27 | effective_leave_days recalculation | A) Recalculate if holiday calendar changes; B) Lock at submission time | **B — Lock at submission time** | Retroactive recalculation after calendar changes would silently modify existing requests. Submitted value is a contract with the requester. |

| Include `day_scope` + `office_departure_time` in create + edit payloads | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Both `createOutWorkRequest` call and `updateOutWorkRequest` in `HrEditRequestModal` updated; edit modal initialises from `request.day_scope` + `request.office_departure_time` |
| Show scope badge in `HrRequestDetailModal` + `HrRequestDetailWorkspace` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Destination tile split into 2-col grid alongside new Scope tile; sky badge for PARTIAL_DAY, slate for FULL_DAY; departure time shown if PARTIAL_DAY |
| Add scope badge column to `HR_REQUEST_COLUMN_DEFS` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | `scope` column added; renders badge + departure time for outWork; "—" for leave |
| Add Scope + Departed columns to `HrRegisterReports.jsx` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | `day_scope` + `office_departure_time` columns added to `OUT_WORK_COLUMN_DEFS`; both in default visible; `resolveColumnValue` handles both |

**Phase 3 Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Full day out-work unchanged, creates day records on approve
- [ ] Partial day out-work: single date enforced, departure time stored
- [ ] Cancellation removes day records for both cases
- [ ] Register shows scope and departure time

| Handle no existing row — INSERT with MANUAL_HR source | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Creates new day record with `source = MANUAL_HR`; `previous_status = null`; returns `action: "CREATED"` |
| Store full audit columns | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | `manually_corrected`, `corrected_by`, `corrected_at`, `correction_note`, `previous_status` all written on every correction |
| Add route in hr.routes.ts | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Import + `POST:/api/hr/attendance/correct` case added |

### Phase 5-C — Frontend [5%]

| Item | Status | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add `manualCorrectDayRecord` to `hrApi.js` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | POST `/api/hr/attendance/correct`; consistent with existing `apiJson` pattern |
| Add "Correct Status" tab to action toggle in `HrAttendanceCorrectionPage` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | 3-way toggle: Apply Leave / Apply Out-Work / Correct Status; amber tone for correction |
| `ManualCorrectionPanel` component | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | PRESENT/ABSENT/MISS_PUNCH toggle buttons + required correction_note textarea; amber styling; calls `manualCorrectDayRecord`; toast + refresh on success |
| Audit trail in day records table | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | New "Correction" column; `manually_corrected = true` → amber "Corrected" badge + previous status + truncated note shown inline |

**Phase 5 Definition of Done:**
- [ ] HR can change Absent → Present for any employee
- [ ] Every correction shows full audit trail
- [ ] LEAVE and OUT_WORK cannot be set via manual correction

## PHASE 6 — HR SUMMARY REPORTS [20%]

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (6-A ✅ 6-B ✅)
**Completed:** 2026-04-28
**Goal:** HR sees all attendance and leave reports with zero manual calculation. Five report screens.
**Prerequisite:** Phase 2 and Phase 3 complete. Phase 7 (backfill) should run before reports are considered accurate for past data.

### Phase 6-A — Backend [10%]

| Item | Status | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create `attendance_reports.handlers.ts` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | `_core/hr/attendance_reports.handlers.ts`; ACL gate `HR_ATTENDANCE_REPORT` READ on all 5 handlers |
| Create `getMonthlyAttendanceSummaryHandler` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | GET `/api/hr/attendance/monthly-summary?year&month`; per-employee count aggregation |
| Create `getDailyAttendanceRegisterHandler` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | GET `/api/hr/attendance/daily-register?from_date&to_date`; 31-day cap; flat records + employee list |
| Create `getYearlyLeaveSummaryHandler` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | GET `/api/hr/attendance/yearly-leave-summary?year&employee_id`; month-by-month leave counts |
| Create `getDepartmentAttendanceReportHandler` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | GET `/api/hr/attendance/department-report?from_date&to_date`; 31-day cap; per-work-context totals via `erp_acl.user_work_contexts` |
| Create `getLeaveUsageReportHandler` (balance = null, policy_configured = false) | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | GET `/api/hr/attendance/leave-usage?year`; per-employee per-leave-type counts; `balance: null` + note in response |
| Add all routes in hr.routes.ts | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | 5 GET cases added to switch; `attendance_reports.handlers.ts` imported |

### Phase 6-B — Frontend [10%]

| Item | Status | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add 5 API functions to `hrApi.js` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary`, `getDailyAttendanceRegister`, `getYearlyLeaveSummary`, `getDepartmentAttendanceReport`, `getLeaveUsageReport` |
| Create `HrMonthlyAttendanceSummaryPage` with CSV export | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Year + month selector; table with 8 status columns; CSV export; F8 hotkey |
| Create `HrDailyAttendanceRegisterPage` (employee × date grid) with CSV export | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Date range picker; sticky employee column; colour-coded abbreviated status cells; legend; flat CSV export |
| Create `HrYearlyLeaveSummaryPage` with CSV export | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Year + employee UUID input; bar chart + table by month; CSV export |
| Create `HrDepartmentAttendanceReportPage` with CSV export | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Date range picker; per-work-context table with grand total row; CSV export |
| Create `HrLeaveUsageReportPage` (balance shows "Not configured") with CSV export | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Year selector; per-employee per-type table; balance col shows "Not configured"; amber Phase 8 notice; CSV export |
| Add 5 screens to `hrScreens.js` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | `HR_ATTENDANCE_MONTHLY_SUMMARY`, `HR_ATTENDANCE_DAILY_REGISTER`, `HR_ATTENDANCE_YEARLY_LEAVE_SUMMARY`, `HR_ATTENDANCE_DEPARTMENT_REPORT`, `HR_ATTENDANCE_LEAVE_USAGE` |
| Add 5 routes to `AppRouter.jsx` | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Imports + Route elements added under `/dashboard` branch |

**Phase 6 Definition of Done:**
- [x] Monthly summary shows correct counts per employee per leave type
- [x] Daily register grid shows correct status per cell
- [x] Yearly summary shows 12-month breakdown for selected employee
- [x] Department report shows department-wise totals
- [x] Leave usage report shows days taken — balance column shows "Not configured"
- [x] CSV export works for all five reports
- [x] Zero manual calculation needed

## PHASE 7 — HISTORICAL BACKFILL [Mandatory, 5%]

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2026-04-28
**Goal:** Populate day records for all historically approved requests.
**Why mandatory:** Without this, HR summary reports are incomplete for all past data.
**Prerequisite:** Phase 2 and Phase 3 complete. Must run immediately after both are done.

| Item | Status | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backfill migration — approved leaves | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Section 1: loops all `current_state = 'APPROVED'` leave requests; calls `upsert_day_record_leave` per date via `generate_series`; HOLIDAY/WEEK_OFF guard preserved; idempotent |
| Backfill migration — approved out-works | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Section 2: same pattern; calls `upsert_day_record_out_work`; PARTIAL_DAY scope + departure time passed through correctly |
| Verification count queries | ✅ | 2026-04-28 | Section 3: commented SELECT queries for `LEAVE_APPROVED`, `OUT_WORK_APPROVED`, total count — run after applying migration to confirm numbers |

**Migration file:** `supabase/migrations/20260428070000_70_7_hr_historical_backfill.sql`

## PHASE 8 — LEAVE POLICY & BALANCE MANAGEMENT [Future]

**Status:** 🔒 BLOCKED — Detailed design session required first
**Goal:** Entitlement configuration, monthly accrual, balance tracking, leave encashment.
**Prerequisite:** Phase 6 complete AND a dedicated design session completed.

⚠ No implementation items listed here yet.
⚠ This section will be filled after the design session.
⚠ Foundation is already in place — leave_types columns + day record counts are ready.

## DECISIONS LOG

Record any decision made during implementation that deviates from or clarifies the plan.

| Date | Phase | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-26 | 1-A | GEN type seeded per-company via unnest multi-row INSERT | Matches plan exactly; ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING ensures idempotency if migration is retried |
| 2026-04-26 | 1-A | `applied_by_auth_user_id` added as nullable | NULL = employee applied for themselves; HR-on-behalf will set this in Phase 4 |
| 2026-04-27 | 1-B / 1-C | Approver can correct `leave_type_id` while request is PENDING; locked after decision | Employee may apply under wrong category; approver is the right checkpoint to fix it before commitment. Documented in design (Part 5 + Invariant 13) and implementation plan (Phase 1-B `updateLeaveRequestHandler`, Phase 1-C `LeaveApprovalInboxPage`). Balance implications (what the corrected type deducts from) are deferred to Phase 8 — cannot be designed without the full leave balance model. |
| 2026-04-27 | 1-B / 1-C | Leave type management authority: HR manages (with `HR_LEAVE_TYPE_MANAGE` permission), SA assigns that permission per company via ACL | Not all companies need the same leave types. HR closest to the business need should manage their own catalogue. SA retains ability to manage directly (for setup/extension) and controls who gets the permission. `type_code` immutable after creation to protect Phase 8 balance logic. Deactivation is soft (is_active = FALSE) — existing records unaffected. New company creation must seed 5 defaults via company creation handler hook. |
